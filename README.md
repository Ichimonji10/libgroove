# libgroove

Audio dispatching library. Generic sink-based interface. Provides decoding,
encoding, resampling, and gain adjustment. Perfect for the backend of a
music player.

## Features

 * Uses [libav](http://www.libav.org/) for robust decoding and encoding.
   - [list of supported formats](http://www.libav.org/general.html#Supported-File-Formats-and-Codecs)
 * Add and remove entries on a playlist for gapless playback.
 * Supports idempotent pause, play, and seek.
 * Per-playlist-item gain adjustment so you can implement loudness compensation
   without audio glitches.
 * Read and write metadata tags.
 * Extensible sink-based interface. A sink provides resampling
   and keeps its buffer full. Types of sinks:
   * **raw sink** - provides reference-counted raw audio buffers you can do
     whatever you like with. For example a real-time audio visualization.
     All other sink types are built on top of this one.
   * **player sink** - sends frames to a sound device.
   * **encoder sink** - provides encoded audio buffers. For example you could
     use this to create an HTTP audio stream.
   * **loudness scanner sink** - uses the [EBU R 128](http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness)
     standard to detect loudness. The values it produces are compatible with
     [ReplayGain](http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=ReplayGain_1.0_specification).
   * ([on the roadmap](https://github.com/andrewrk/libgroove/issues/19)) accoustid fingerprint
 * Thread-safe.
 * Example programs included:
   * `playlist` - play a series of songs with gapless playback
   * `metadata` - read or update song metadata
   * `replaygain` - report the suggested replaygain for a set of files
   * `transcode` - transcode one or more files into one output file
 * Cross-platform.

## Dependencies

You will need these to compile libgroove. Some dependencies are bundled
so that you can still compile if they cannot be found on your system.

 * [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/)
 * [libav](http://libav.org). (bundled) if using bundled version, needs these:
   - [libbz2-dev](http://www.bzip.org/)
   - [yasm](http://yasm.tortall.net/)
   - [libmp3lame-dev](http://lame.sourceforge.net/)
 * [libebur128](https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128) (bundled)
 * [libsdl2-dev](http://www.libsdl.org/) (bundled)
